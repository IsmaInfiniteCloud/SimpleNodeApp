Create a new directory for your project:
 
mkdir my-node-project
Navigate into the new directory:
 
cd my-node-project
Initialize a new Node.js project with default settings:

 
npm init -y
This will create a package.json file that includes information about your project and its dependencies.

Create an entry point file for your project. The default name for this file is index.js, but you can name it whatever you like.


touch index.js
Install any dependencies your project needs. For example, if you want to use the popular express framework:

 
npm install express
This will install express and add it to your project's package.json file.

Start your Node.js application:

 
node index.js
